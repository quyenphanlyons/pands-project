## Description of Iris data set


Data set [iris.data](https://github.com/quyenphanlyons/pands-project/blob/main/iris/iris.data) can be found in [iris folder](https://github.com/quyenphanlyons/pands-project/tree/main/iris).

This data set is one of the earliest datasets widely used in statistics and machine learning. 

This is a small data set that contains only 150 observations. Each observation in this data set is an iris flower. The data set consists of 50 individuals from each of three following species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica. The data set has 5 columns which are 4 features (quantitative variables) and 1 class label (nominal variable).

The 4 features are:
1. sepal length (in cm) represents the length of an iris flower's sepal.
2. sepal width (in cm) represents the width of an iris flower's sepal
3. petal length (in cm) represents the length of an iris flower's petal
4. petal width (in cm) represents the width of an iris flower's petal

## Purpose
The aime of this project is to explore the data set by using statistics methods such as:

- Descriptive statistics of features in the data set
- Find the relationship between variables by using the correlation matrix
- Visualise data by using
    - Histograms
    - Pair Plots (Scatter Matrix)
    - Boxplots

## Program language
The program language used for this project is Python.

The libraries used in this project are `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Analyse program for Iris data set

Python analysis program is in [analysis.py](https://github.com/quyenphanlyons/pands-project/blob/main/analysis.py).

The sections of the program and theirs outputs are visualised in [notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/quyenphanlyons/pands-project/blob/main/notebook.ipynb).

Descriptive statistics of Iris data set can be found in [Iris_stats_summary.txt](https://github.com/quyenphanlyons/pands-project/blob/main/Iris_stats_summary.txt)
