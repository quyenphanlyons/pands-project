This data set is one of the earliest datasets widely used in statistics and machine learning. 

This is a small data set that contains only 150 observations. Each observation in this data set is an iris flower. The data set consists of 50 individuals from each of three following species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica. The data set has 5 columns which are 4 features (continuous variables) and 1 class label (nominal variable).

The 4 features are:
1. sepal length (in cm) represents the length of an iris flower's sepal.
2. sepal width (in cm) represents the width of an iris flower's sepal
3. petal length (in cm) represents the length of an iris flower's petal
4. petal width (in cm) represents the width of an iris flower's petal
