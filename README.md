## About Iris dataset


This dataset is one of the earliest datasets widely used in statistics and machine learning. 

This is a small dataset that contains only 150 individuals and 5 features. This dataset doesn't have any missing value. 
Each individual in this datset is an iris flower.

The 5 features are:
    1. sepal length (in cm) represent the length of an iris flower's sepal
    2. sepal width (in cm) represent the width of an iris flower's sepal
    3. petal length (in cm) represent the length of an iris flower's petal
    4. petal width (in cm) represent the width of an iris flower's petal
    5. class represent the spieces of an iris flower which can takes one of these 3 following values: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour or Iris Virginica

The first 4 features are continuous variables. The last one (class) is nominal variable.
