## Description of Iris dataset


The dataset [iris.data](https://github.com/quyenphanlyons/pands-project/blob/main/iris/iris.data) can be found in [iris folder](https://github.com/quyenphanlyons/pands-project/tree/main/iris).

This dataset is one of the earliest datasets widely used in statistics and machine learning. 

This is a small dataset that contains only 150 observations. Each observation in this dataset is an iris flower. The dataset consists of 50 individuals from each of the following three species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica. The dataset has 5 columns: 4 features (quantitative variables) and 1 class label (nominal variable).

The 4 features are:
1. sepal length (in cm) represents the length of an iris flower's sepal.
2. sepal width (in cm) represents the width of an iris flower's sepal
3. petal length (in cm) represents the length of an iris flower's petal
4. petal width (in cm) represents the width of an iris flower's petal

## Purpose
The aime of this project is to explore the dataset by using statistical methods such as:

- Descriptive statistics of features in the dataset
- Finding the relationships between variables by using the correlation matrix
- Data visualisation using
    - Histograms
    - Pair Plots (Scatter Matrix)
    - Boxplots

## Programming language
The programming language used for this project is Python.

The libraries used in this project are `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Analysis program for Iris dataset

The Python analysis program is in [analysis.py](https://github.com/quyenphanlyons/pands-project/blob/main/analysis.py).

The sections of the program and their outputs are visualised in [notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/quyenphanlyons/pands-project/blob/main/notebook.ipynb).

Descriptive statistics of the Iris dataset can be found in [Iris_stats_summary.txt](https://github.com/quyenphanlyons/pands-project/blob/main/Iris_stats_summary.txt)
